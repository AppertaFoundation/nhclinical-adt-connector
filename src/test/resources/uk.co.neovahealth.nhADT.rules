# Rules take the form of:
# ACTION | EXPRESSION | ERROR
#
# ACTION can be either ACCEPT or REJECT
#
# EXPRESSION can use any field_name (defined in .conf file) and can use the following:
#   EXISTS
#   >,>=,<,<=,==,!=,~=
#   ONEOF [list,of,values]
#
# EXPRESSIONS can be logically combined using:
#   AND
#   OR
#   NOT
#
# Each EXPRESSION MUST be wrapped in parentheses to aid parsing (yes my parser is lame)
#
# The error section is made up of two parts, the error command, and the message.
# The error command can be either ERROR or IGNORE
# The message is taken to the the rest of the line
#
# See the output of RuleParserTest.check_arb_rules for further examples

# Only accept messages we can process
ACCEPT | (msg_type ONEOF [A01,A02,A03,A05,A08,A11,A12,A13,A28,A31,A40]) | ERROR Unsupported message type

# Reject messages that have a discharge date (as historical) - except discharge and cancelDischarge messages
REJECT | ((discharge_date EXISTS) AND ((msg_type != A03) OR (msg_type != A13))) | IGNORE Ignoring Historical message
