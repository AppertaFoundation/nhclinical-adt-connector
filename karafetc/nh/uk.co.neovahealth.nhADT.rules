# Rules take the form of:
# ACTION | EXPRESSION | ERROR
#
# ACTION can be either ACCEPT or REJECT
#
# EXPRESSION can use any field_name (defined in .conf file) and can use the following:
#   EXISTS
#   >,>=,<,<=,==,!=,~=
#   ONEOF [list,of,values]
#
# EXPRESSIONS can be logically combined using:
#   AND
#   OR
#   NOT
#
# Each EXPRESSION must be wrapped in parentheses to aid parsing
#
# The error section is made up of two parts, the error command, and the message.
# The error command can be either ERROR or IGNORE
# The message is taken to the the rest of the line
#
# See the output of RuleParserTest.check_arb_rules for further examples
